01 – What is DevOps?

DevOps is a culture, mindset, and set of practices that bring together software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the software delivery lifecycle.  
Its goal is to deliver high-quality software **quickly, reliably, and continuously** through automation, collaboration, and monitoring.

How a DevOps Engineer Helps a Team

A DevOps engineer acts as the bridge between developers and system administrators.  
They automate builds, deployments, testing, and monitoring so teams can:
- Ship features faster and more reliably.
- Recover quickly from failures.
- Reduce manual repetitive work.
- Improve communication between dev and ops teams.

A DevOps engineer might set up a CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds, tests, and deploys a web app to a staging environment each time a developer pushes code — ensuring faster feedback and fewer errors.

3 Tools or Concepts I Recognize

1. **CI/CD** – Automating build, test, and deployment pipelines.  
2. **Terraform** – Managing infrastructure as code.  
3. **Ansible** – Automating configuration and system setup.
